# SpecificGames

This repository contains tools, scripts, and resources for working with specific game projects — primarily **Japanese visual novels (VNs)** and similar titles.

The goal of this repo is to help with:
- Extracting / unpacking game data
- Repacking or modifying assets
- Translation tools and workflow utilities
- Reverse engineering helpers
- Format research and documentation

This is not a general-purpose repo — everything here is focused on particular game engines and projects, handled case-by-case.
