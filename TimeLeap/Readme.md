# TimeLeap Tools

This repository contains tools and utilities for working with the visual novel **Time Leap**  
(https://vndb.org/v759).

Currently, the focus is on supporting **extraction of the game's `.dat` archive files**.  
This allows access to the internal game assets for research, translation, and modding.

## Features

- ✅ Extract `.dat` archive files used by **Time Leap**
- 🗂 Dumps files into readable directory structure
- 🔍 Useful for asset inspection and reverse engineering work
- 🛠 Intended primarily for *translation and modding workflows*

## Limitations / WIP

- ❌ Repacking / rebuilding `.dat` archives is **not supported yet**
- ❌ No automatic script or text extraction helpers yet
- 💡 Additional engine format research is ongoing

## Use Case

These tools are intended for:
- Fan translation projects
- Game data analysis
- Internal engine format study
- Modding and restoration work

## Disclaimer

This project is provided for **educational and archival purposes only.**  
No game data is included.  
You must legally own the game to extract and use its assets.

More features will be added as reverse engineering progresses.
