# TimeLeap Tools

This repository contains tools and utilities for working with the visual novel **Time Leap**  
(https://vndb.org/v759).

Currently, the focus is on supporting **extraction of the game's `.dat` archive files**.  
This allows access to the internal game assets for research, translation, and modding.

## Features

- ✅ Extract files from the game's `.dat` archives
- ✅ Repack files back into `.dat` archives (preserves index layout)
- 🗂 Dumped files preserve directory structure recorded in the archive index
- 🔁 Round-trip support for basic modify → repack → test workflows
- 🔍 Tooling intended for asset inspection, translation and format research

## Limitations / WIP

- 💡 Additional engine format research is ongoing

## Use Case

These tools are intended for:
- Fan translation projects
- Game data analysis
- Internal engine format study
- Modding and restoration work

## Disclaimer

This project is provided for **educational and archival purposes only.**  
No game data is included.  
You must legally own the game to extract and use its assets.

More features will be added as reverse engineering progresses.
